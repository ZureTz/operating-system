# Banker’s Algorithm

This project is a multithreaded program that implements the banker’s algorithm.

Several customers request and release resources from the bank. The banker will grant a request only if it leaves the system in a safe state.

This program combines three separate topics: 

- multithreading
- preventing race conditions
- deadlock avoidance
